# Permutations

## Tests from the examples in

## Syntax modifications needed to convert Python code to SymPy.jl code
## p.size(a,b,c) -> size(p,a,b,c)
## p.property -> p |> property or property(p)
## A few cases need a function to be passed in and notation (pymethod) for this needs to be ironed out.

# Array Notation And 2-line Form
p = Permutation([0, 2, 1]); p
# Permutation([0, 2, 1])

# Given i in range(size(p)), the permutation maps i to i^p
@test [i^p for i in range(size(p))] == [0,2,1]
# [0, 2, 1]

## The composite of two permutations p*q means first apply p, then q, so i^(p*q) = (i^p)^q which is i^p^q according to Python precedence rules:

q = Permutation([2, 1, 0])
@test [(i^p)^q for i in range(3)] == [2,0,1]  ## JULIA AND PYTHON DIFFER
# [2, 0, 1]
@test [i^(p*q) for i in range(3)] == [2,0,1]
# [2, 0, 1]
# One can use also the notation p(i) = i^p, but then the composition rule is (p*q)(i) = q(p(i)), not p(q(i)):

@test [(p*q)(i) for i in range(size(p))] == [2,0,1]
# [2, 0, 1]
@test [q(p(i)) for i in range(size(p))] == [2,0,1]
# [2, 0, 1]
@test [p(q(i)) for i in range(size(p))] == [1,2,0]
# [1, 2, 0]


# Disjoint Cycle Notation

# In disjoint cycle notation, only the elements that have shifted are indicated. In the above case, the 2 and 1 switched places. This can be entered in two ways:

@test Permutation(1, 2) == Permutation([[1, 2]]) == p
# True
# Only the relative ordering of elements in a cycle matter:


@test Permutation(1,2,3) == Permutation(2,3,1) == Permutation(3,1,2)
# True
# The disjoint cycle notation is convenient when representing permutations that have several cycles in them:


@test Permutation(1, 2)(3, 5) == Permutation([[1, 2], [3, 5]])
# True
# It also provides some economy in entry when computing products of permutations that are written in disjoint cycle notation:


wtf = Permutation(1, 2)(1, 3)(2, 3)
# Permutation([0, 3, 2, 1])
@test wtf == Permutation([[1, 2]])*Permutation([[1, 3]])*Permutation([[2, 3]])  ## ans = _
# True
# Caution: when the cycles have common elements between them then the order in which the permutations are applied matters. The convention is that the permutations are applied from right to left. In the following, the transposition of elements 2 and 3 is followed by the transposition of elements 1 and 2:


@test Permutation(1, 2)(2, 3) == Permutation([(1, 2), (2, 3)])
# True
@test list(Permutation(1, 2)(2, 3)) == [0,3,1,2]
# [0, 3, 1, 2]
# If the first and second elements had been swapped first, followed by the swapping of the second and third, the result would have been [0, 2, 3, 1]. If, for some reason, you want to apply the cycles in the order they are entered, you can simply reverse the order of cycles:


@test (Permutation([(1, 2), (2, 3)] |> reverse) |> list) == [0,2,3,1]
# [0, 2, 3, 1]
# Entering a singleton in a permutation is a way to indicate the size of the permutation. The size keyword can also be used.

# Array-form entry:


Permutation([[1, 2], [9]])
# Permutation([0, 2, 1], size=10)
Permutation([[1, 2]], size=10)
# Permutation([0, 2, 1], size=10)
# Cyclic-form entry:


p = Permutation(1, 2, size=10)
# Permutation([0, 2, 1], size=10)
Permutation(9)(1, 2) == p
# Permutation([0, 2, 1], size=10)
# Caution: no singleton containing an element larger than the largest in any previous cycle can be entered. This is an important difference in how Permutation and Cycle handle the __call__ syntax. A singleton argument at the start of a Permutation performs instantiation of the Permutation and is permitted:


Permutation(5)
# Permutation([], size=6)
# A singleton entered after instantiation is a call to the permutation – a function call – and if the argument is out of range it will trigger an error. For this reason, it is better to start the cycle with the singleton:

# The following fails because there is is no element 3:


## This throws as expected Permutation(1, 2)(3)
# Traceback (most recent call last):
# ...
# IndexError: list index out of range
# This is ok: only the call to an out of range singleton is prohibited; otherwise the permutation autosizes:


Permutation(3)(1, 2)
# Permutation([0, 2, 1, 3])
@test Permutation(1, 2)(3, 4) == Permutation(3, 4)(1, 2)
# True
# Equality Testing

# The array forms must be the same in order for permutations to be equal:


@test !(Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3]) == Permutation([1, 0]))
# False
# Identity Permutation

# The identity permutation is a permutation in which no element is out of place. It can be entered in a variety of ways. All the following create an identity permutation of size 4:


I = Permutation([0, 1, 2, 3])
@test all(p == I for p in [Permutation(3), Permutation(range(4)), Permutation([], size=4), Permutation(size=4)])
# ... Permutation(3),
# ... Permutation(range(4)),
# ... Permutation([], size=4),
# ... Permutation(size=4)])
# True
# Watch out for entering the range inside a set of brackets (which is cycle notation):


@test I != Permutation([range(4)])
# False
# Permutation Printing

# There are a few things to note about how Permutations are printed.

# 1) If you prefer one form (array or cycle) over another, you can set that with the print_cyclic flag.


p = Permutation(1, 2)(4, 5)(3, 4)
# Permutation([0, 2, 1, 4, 5, 3])

### p
# (1 2)(3 4 5)
# 2) Regardless of the setting, a list of elements in the array for cyclic form can be obtained and either of those can be copied and supplied as the argument to Permutation:


@test array_form(p) == [0, 2, 1, 4, 5, 3]
# [0, 2, 1, 4, 5, 3]
@test cyclic_form(p) == [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]
# [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]
@test Permutation(cyclic_form(p)) == p
# True
# 3) Printing is economical in that as little as possible is printed while retaining all information about the size of the permutation:


Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3])
# Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3])
Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3], size=20)
# Permutation([1, 0], size=20)
Permutation([1, 0, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6], size=20)
# Permutation([1, 0, 2, 4, 3], size=20)

p = Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3])
p
# (3)(0 1)
# The 2 was not printed but it is still there as can be seen with the array_form and size methods:


@test array_form(p) == [1, 0, 2, 3]
# [1, 0, 2, 3]
@test size(p) == 4
# 4
# Short Introduction To Other Methods

# The permutation can act as a bijective function, telling what element is located at a given position


q = Permutation([5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 0])
@test array_form(q)[2] == 2 # the hard way -- indexing is 1-base
# 2
@test q(1) == 2 # the easy way -- function call 0-based
# 2
@test [i => q(i) for i in range(size(q))] == [0 => 5, 1 => 2, 2 => 3, 3 => 4, 4 => 1, 5 => 0]
# {0: 5, 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 1, 5: 0}
# The full cyclic form (including singletons) can be obtained:


@test full_cyclic_form(p) == [[0, 1], [2], [3]]
# [[0, 1], [2], [3]]
# Any permutation can be factored into transpositions of pairs of elements:


as = [Permutation(1, 2), Permutation(3, 5), Permutation(3, 4)]
@test transpositions(Permutation([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]])) == as
# [(1, 2), (3, 5), (3, 4)]
@test *([Permutation(ai, size=6) for ai in as]...) == Permutation(1,2)(3,5,4)
@test rmul([Permutation(ai, size=6) for ai in as]...) == Permutation([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]])
# [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]


# The number of permutations on a set of n elements is given by n! and is called the cardinality.
@test size(p) == 4
# 4
@test cardinality(p) == 24
# 24

# A given permutation has a rank among all the possible permutations of the same elements, but what that rank is depends on how the permutations are enumerated. (There are a number of different methods of doing so.) The lexicographic rank is given by the rank method and this rank is used to increment a permutation with addition/subtraction:

@test rank(p) == 6
# 6
@test p + 1 == Permutation([1, 0, 3, 2])
# Permutation([1, 0, 3, 2])
tmp = next_lex(p)
@test tmp == Permutation([1, 0, 3, 2])
# Permutation([1, 0, 3, 2])
@test rank(tmp) == 7
# 7
@test unrank_lex(size(p), rank=7) == Permutation([1, 0, 3, 2])
# Permutation([1, 0, 3, 2])
# The product of two permutations p and q is defined as their composition as functions, (p*q)(i) = q(p(i)) [R33].


p = Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3])
q = Permutation([2, 3, 1, 0])
@test list(q*p) == [2, 3, 0, 1]
# [2, 3, 0, 1]
@test list(p*q) == [3,2,1,0]
# [3, 2, 1, 0]
@test [q(p(i)) for i in range(size(p))] == [3,2,1,0]
# [3, 2, 1, 0]
# The permutation can be ‘applied’ to any list-like object, not only Permutations:


@test p(["zero", "one", "four", "two"]) ==  ["one", "zero", "four", "two"]
#  ['one', 'zero', 'four', 'two']
@test p("zo42") == ["o", "z", "4", "2"]
# ['o', 'z', '4', '2']

# Return as a permutation the shuffling of range(n) using the Josephus scheme in which every m-th item is selected until all have been chosen. The returned permutation has elements listed by the order in which they were selected.

# The parameter s stops the selection process when there are s items remaining and these are selected by continuing the selection, counting by 1 rather than by m.

# Consider selecting every 3rd item from 6 until only 2 remain:

# The class defining a Permutation group.
# The permutations corresponding to motion of the front, right and bottom face of a 2x2 Rubik’s cube are defined:


F = Permutation(2, 19, 21, 8)(3, 17, 20, 10)(4, 6, 7, 5)
R = Permutation(1, 5, 21, 14)(3, 7, 23, 12)(8, 10, 11, 9)
D = Permutation(6, 18, 14, 10)(7, 19, 15, 11)(20, 22, 23, 21)
# These are passed as permutations to PermutationGroup:


G = PermutationGroup(F, R, D)
@test order(G) == 3674160
# 3674160
# The group can be supplied to a Polyhedron in order to track the objects being moved. An example involving the 2x2 Rubik’s cube is given there, but here is a simple demonstration:


a = Permutation(2, 1)
b = Permutation(1, 0)
G = PermutationGroup(a, b)
# P = Polyhedron(list('ABC'), pgroup=G)
# P.corners
# (A, B, C)
# P.rotate(0) # apply permutation 0
# P.corners
# (A, C, B)
# P.reset()
# P.corners
# (A, B, C)
# Or one can make a permutation as a product of selected permutations and apply them to an iterable directly:


P10 = make_perm(G, [0, 1])
@test P10("ABC") == ["C", "A", "B"]
# ['C', 'A', 'B']
# base
# Return a base# from the Schreier-Sims algorithm.

# For a permutation group GG, a base is a sequence of points B=(b1,b2,...,bk)B=(b1,b2,...,bk) such that no element of GG apart# from the identity fixes all the points in BB. The concepts of a base and strong generating set and their applications are discussed in depth in [1], pp. 87-89 and [2], pp. 55-57.

# An alternative way to think of BB is that it gives the indices of the stabilizer cosets that contain more than the identity permutation.

    # baseswap(base, strong_gens, pos, randomized=False, transversals=None, basic_orbits=None, strong_gens_distr=None)[source]
# Swap two consecutive base points in base and strong generating set.

# If a base for a group GG is given by (b1,b2,...,bk)(b1,b2,...,bk), this function returns a base (b1,b2,...,bi+1,bi,...,bk)(b1,b2,...,bi+1,bi,...,bk), where ii is given by pos, and a strong generating set relative to that base. The original base and strong generating set are not modified.

# The randomized version (default) is of Las Vegas type.

# Parameters:
# base, strong_gens
# The base and strong generating set.
# pos
# The position at which swapping is performed.
# randomized
# A switch between randomized and deterministic version.
# transversals
# The transversals for the basic orbits, if known.
# basic_orbits

# strong_gens_distr
# The strong generators distributed by basic stabilizers, if known.
# Returns:

# See also schreier_sims
# Notes

# The deterministic version of the algorithm is discussed in [1], pp. 102-103; the randomized version is discussed in [1], p.103, and [2], p.98. It is of Las Vegas type. Notice that [1] contains a mistake in the pseudocode and discussion of BASESWAP: on line 3 of the pseudocode, |β⟨T⟩i+1||βi+1⟨T⟩| should be replaced by |β⟨T⟩i||βi⟨T⟩|, and the same for the discussion of the algorithm.

# centralizer(other)[source]
# Return the centralizer of a group/set/element.

# The centralizer of a set of permutations S inside a group G is the set of elements of G that commute with all elements of S:

# Usually, S is a subset of G, but if G is a proper subgroup of the full symmetric group, we allow for S to have elements outside G.

# It is naturally a subgroup of G; the centralizer of a permutation group is equal to the centralizer of any set of generators for that group, since any element commuting with the generators commutes with any product of the generators.

# Parameters:

# See also _check_cycles_alt_sym
# Notes

# The algorithm itself uses some nontrivial results# from group theory and number theory: 1) If a transitive group G of degree n contains an element with a cycle of length n/2 < p < n-2 for p a prime, G is the symmetric or alternating group ([1], pp. 81-82) 2) The proportion of elements in the symmetric/alternating group having the property described in 1) is approximately log(2)/log(n)log⁡(2)/log⁡(n) ([1], p.82; [2], pp. 226-227). The helper function _check_cycles_alt_sym is used to go over the cycles in a permutation and look for ones satisfying 1).

# See also minimal_block, random_stab
# Notes

# The algorithm is described in [1], p.83, and uses the function minimal_block to search for blocks of the form {0,k}{0,k} for k ranging over representatives for the orbits of G0G0, the stabilizer of 0. This algorithm has complexity O(n2)O(n2) where n is the degree of the group, and will perform badly if G0G0 is small.

# There are two implementations offered: one finds G0G0 deterministically using the function stabilizer, and the other (default) produces random elements of G0G0 using random_stab, hoping that they generate a subgroup of G0G0 with not too many more orbits than G0G0 (this is suggested in [1], p.83).

# minimal_block(points)[source]
# For a transitive group, finds the block system generated by points.

# If a group G acts on a set S, a nonempty subset B of S is called a block under the action of G if for all g in G we have gB = B (g fixes B) or gB and B have no common points (g moves B entirely). ([1], p.23; [6]).

# The distinct translates gB of a block B for g in G partition the set S and this set of translates is known as a block system. Moreover, we obviously have that all blocks in the partition have the same size, hence the block size divides |S| ([1], p.23). A G-congruence is an equivalence relation ~ on the set S such that a ~ b implies g(a) ~ g(b) for all g in G. For a transitive group, the equivalence classes of a G-congruence and the blocks of a block system are the same thing ([1], p.23).

# The algorithm below checks the group for transitivity, and then finds the G-congruence generated by the pairs (p_0, p_1), (p_0, p_2), ..., (p_0,p_{k-1}) which is the same as finding the maximal block system (i.e., the one with minimum block size) such that p_0, ..., p_{k-1} are in the same block ([1], p.83).

# It is an implementation of Atkinson’s algorithm, as suggested in [1], and manipulates an equivalence relation on the set S using a union-find data structure. The running time is just above O(|points||S|)O(|points||S|). ([1], pp. 83-87; [7]).

# For a permutation group GG and a set of points {p1,p2,…,pk}{p1,p2,…,pk}, the pointwise stabilizer of p1,p2,…,pkp1,p2,…,pk is defined as Gp1,…,pk={g∈G|g(pi)=pi∀i∈{1,2,…,k}}Gp1,…,pk={g∈G|g(pi)=pi∀i∈{1,2,…,k}} ([1],p20). It is a subgroup of GG.

# See also stabilizer, schreier_sims_incremental
# Notes

# When incremental == True, rather than the obvious implementation using successive calls to .stabilizer(), this uses the incremental Schreier-Sims algorithm to obtain a base with starting segment - the given points.

# Examples


# from sympy.combinatorics.named_groups import SymmetricGroup
S = SymmetricGroup(7)
Stab = pointwise_stabilizer(S, [2, 3, 5]) ## note PyVector usage

# schreier_sims()[source]
# Schreier-Sims algorithm.

# It computes the generators of the chain of stabilizers G>Gb1>..>Gb1,..,br>1G>Gb1>..>Gb1,..,br>1 in which Gb1,..,biGb1,..,bi stabilizes b1,..,bib1,..,bi, and the corresponding s cosets. An element of the group can be written as the product h1∗..∗hsh1∗..∗hs.

# We use the incremental Schreier-Sims algorithm.

# schreier_sims_incremental(base=None, gens=None)[source]
# Extend a sequence of points and generating set to a base and strong generating set.

# Parameters:
# base
# The sequence of points to be extended to a base. Optional parameter with default value [].
# gens
# The generating set to be extended to a strong generating set relative to the base obtained. Optional parameter with default value self.generators.
# Returns:
# (base, strong_gens)
# base is the base obtained, and strong_gens is the strong generating set relative to it. The original parameters base, gens remain unchanged.
# See also schreier_sims, schreier_sims_random
# Notes

# This version of the Schreier-Sims algorithm runs in polynomial time. There are certain assumptions in the implementation - if the trivial group is provided, base and gens are returned immediately, as any sequence of points is a base for the trivial group. If the identity is present in the generators gens, it is removed as it is a redundant generator. The implementation is described in [1], pp. 90-93.

# schreier_sims_random(base=None, gens=None, consec_succ=10, _random_prec=None)[source]
# Randomized Schreier-Sims algorithm.

# The randomized Schreier-Sims algorithm takes the sequence base and the generating set gens, and extends base to a base, and gens to a strong generating set relative to that base with probability of a wrong answer at most 2−consec_succ2−consec_succ, provided the random generators are sufficiently random.

# Parameters:
# base
# The sequence to be extended to a base.
# gens
# The generating set to be extended to a strong generating set.
# consec_succ
# The parameter defining the probability of a wrong answer.
# _random_prec
# An internal parameter used for testing purposes.
# Returns:
# (base, strong_gens)
# base is the base and strong_gens is the strong generating set relative to it.
# See also schreier_sims
# Notes

# The algorithm is described in detail in [1], pp. 97-98. It extends the orbits orbs and the permutation groups stabs to basic orbits and basic stabilizers for the base and strong generating set produced in the end. The idea of the extension process is to “sift” random group elements through the stabilizer chain and amend the stabilizers/orbits along the way when a sift is not successful. The helper function _strip is used to attempt to decompose a random group element according to the current state of the stabilizer chain and report whether the element was fully decomposed (successful sift) or not (unsuccessful sift). In the latter case, the level at which the sift failed is reported and used to amend stabs, base, gens and orbs accordingly. The halting condition is for consec_succ consecutive successful sifts to pass. This makes sure that the current base and gens form a BSGS with probability at least 1−1/consec\_succ1−1/consec\_succ.

# Examples


# from sympy.combinatorics.perm_groups import PermutationGroup
# from sympy.combinatorics.testutil import _verify_bsgs
# from sympy.combinatorics.named_groups import SymmetricGroup

## -----

# schreier_vector(alpha)[source]
# Computes the schreier vector for alpha.

# The Schreier vector efficiently stores information about the orbit of alpha. It can later be used to quickly obtain elements of the group that send alpha to a particular element in the orbit. Notice that the Schreier vector depends on the order in which the group generators are listed. For a definition, see [3]. Since list indices start# from zero, we adopt the convention to use “None” instead of 0 to signify that an element doesn’t belong to the orbit. For the algorithm and its correctness, see [2], pp.78-80.

# strong_gens
# Return a strong generating set# from the Schreier-Sims algorithm.

# A generating set S={g1,g2,...,gt}S={g1,g2,...,gt} for a permutation group GG is a strong generating set relative to the sequence of points (referred to as a “base”) (b1,b2,...,bk)(b1,b2,...,bk) if, for 1≤i≤k1≤i≤k we have that the intersection of the pointwise stabilizer G(i+1):=Gb1,b2,...,biG(i+1):=Gb1,b2,...,bi with SS generates the pointwise stabilizer G(i+1)G(i+1). The concepts of a base and strong generating set and their applications are discussed in depth in [1], pp. 87-89 and [2], pp. 55-57.

# subgroup_search(prop, base=None, strong_gens=None, tests=None, init_subgroup=None)[source]
# Find the subgroup of all elements satisfying the property prop.

# This is done by a depth-first search with respect to base images that uses several tests to prune the search tree.

# Parameters:
# prop
# The property to be used. Has to be callable on group elements and always return True or False. It is assumed that all group elements satisfying prop indeed form a subgroup.
# base
# A base for the supergroup.
# strong_gens
# A strong generating set for the supergroup.
# tests
# A list of callables of length equal to the length of base. These are used to rule out group elements by partial base images, so that tests[l](g) returns False if the element g is known not to satisfy prop base on where g sends the first l + 1 base points.
# init_subgroup
# if a subgroup of the sought group is known in advance, it can be passed to the function as this parameter.
# Returns:
# res
# The subgroup of all elements satisfying prop. The generating set for this group is guaranteed to be a strong generating set relative to the base base.
# Notes

# This function is extremely lenghty and complicated and will require some careful attention. The implementation is described in [1], pp. 114-117, and the comments for the code here follow the lines of the pseudocode in the book for clarity.

# The complexity is exponential in general, since the search process by itself visits all members of the supergroup. However, there are a lot of tests which are used to prune the search tree, and users can define their own tests via the tests parameter, so in practice, and for some computations, it’s not terrible.

# A crucial part in the procedure is the frequent base change performed (this is line 11 in the pseudocode) in order to obtain a new basic stabilizer. The book mentiones that this can be done by using .baseswap(...), however the current imlementation uses a more straightforward way to find the next basic stabilizer - calling the function .stabilizer(...) on the previous basic stabilizer.
