# The SymPy tutorial (1.3) in `Julia`


## About `SymPy.jl`

The `SymPy` package for `Julia` allows `Julia` users to interact with  python's SymPy module in a mostly seamless manner, thanks to the power of the `PyCall` package for `Julia`. The following pages reexpress the SymPy tutorial illustrating the associated `Julia` commands. There are some changes, but mostly modest ones.
