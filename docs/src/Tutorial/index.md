# The SymPy tutorial (1.3) in `Julia`

Here the  tutorial for  SymPy 1.3 is re-expressed using Julia commands and `SymPy.jl`. It shows the similarities and differences in use under Python and `Julia`.

----

The `SymPy` package for `Julia` allows `Julia` users to interact with  python's SymPy module in a mostly seamless manner, thanks to the power of the `PyCall` package for `Julia`. The following pages reexpress the SymPy tutorial illustrating the associated `Julia` commands. There are some changes, but mostly modest ones. To create these pages,  the  `.rst` files  were downloaded and modfied. There is  only hand sychronization available with  new  versions of  the  SymPy tutorial   for Python.
