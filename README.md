# SymPy Package to bring Python's `Sympy` functionality into `Julia` via `PyCall`



The `SymPy` package  (`http://sympy.org/`)  is a Python library for symbolic mathematics.

With the excellent `PyCall` package of `julia`, one has access to the
many features of `SymPy` from within a `Julia` session.

This `SymPy` package provides a light interface for _some_ of the
features of `SymPy` that makes working with `SymPy` objects a bit
easier.

The [tutorial](examples/tutorial.md) provides an overview. It is
viewable as an `IJulia` notebook
[here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jverzani/SymPy.jl/blob/master/examples/tutorial.ipynb).

### Installation

To use this package, both `Python` and its `SymPy` library must be
installed on your system. If `PyCall` is installed using `Conda`
(which is the default if no system `python` is found), then the
underlying `SymPy` library will be installed via `Conda` when the
package is first loaded. Otherwise, installing both `Python` and
`SymPy` (which also requires `mpmath`) can be done by other means.
In this case, the `Anaconda` distribution is suggested, as it provides a single
installation of `Python` that includes `SymPy` and many other
scientific libraries that can be profitably accessed within `Julia`
via `PyCall`. (Otherwise, install `Python` then download the `sympy`
library from https://github.com/sympy/sympy/releases and install.)

## The `PyCall` interface to `SymPy`

The only point to this package is that using `PyCall` to access
`SymPy` is somewhat cumbersome. The following is how one would define
a symbolic value `x`, take its sine, then evaluate at `pi`, say:

```
using PyCall
sympy = pyimport("sympy")
x = sympy.Symbol("x")
y = sympy.sin(x)
z = y.subs(x, sympy.pi)
convert(Float64, z)
```

The `Symbol` and `sin` function of `SymPy` are found within the
imported `sympy` object. They may be referenced with `Python`'s dot
notation. Similarly, the `subs` method of the `y` object may be
accessed with Python's dot nottation using PyCall's `getproperty`
overload to call the method. The call above substitutes a value of
`sympy.pi` for `x`. This leaves the object as a `PyObject` storing a
number which can be brought back into `julia` through conversion, in
this case through an explicit `convert` call.


Alternatively, `PyCall` now has a `*` method, so this could be done with

```
x = sympy.Symbol("x")
y = sympy.pi * x
z = sympy.sin(y)
convert(Float64, z.subs(x, 1))
```

With `SymPy` this gets replaced by a more `julia`n syntax:

```
using SymPy
x = symbols("x")		       # or   @vars x, Sym("x"), or  Sym(:x)
y = sin(pi*x)
y(1)                           # Does subs(y, x, 1). Use y(x=>1) to be specific as to which symbol to substitute
```

The object `x` we create is of type `Sym`, a simple proxy for the
underlying `PyObject`. We then overload the familiar math functions so
that working with symbolic expressions can use natural `julia`
idioms. The final result  here is a symbolic value of `0`, which
prints as `0` and not `PyObject 0`. To convert it into a numeric value
within `Julia`, the `N` function may be used, which acts like the
float conversion, only there is an attempt to preserve the variable type.

(There is a subtlety, the value of `pi` here (an `Irrational` in
`Julia`) is converted to the symbolic `PI`, but in general won't be if
the math constant is coerced to a floating point value before it
encounters a symbolic object. It is better to just use the symbolic
value `PI`, an alias for `sympy.pi` used above. A similar comment
applies for `e`, where `E` should be used.)

However, for some tasks the `PyCall` interface is still needed, as
only a portion of the `SymPy` interface is exposed. To call an
underlying SymPy method, the `getproperty` method is overloaded so
that `ex.meth_name(...)` dispatches the method of the object and
`sympy.meth_name(...)` calls a function in the SymPy module.

For example, we could have been more explicit and used:

```
y = sympy.sin(pi * x)
y.subs(x, 1)
```

As calling the underlying SymPy function is not difficult, the
interface exposed through overloading `Julia`'s methods attempts to
keep similar functionality to the familiar `Julia` method when there is
a discrepancy between conventions.

## Notes

Some aspects of `SymPy` require more modern versions of `sympy` to be
installed. For example, the matrix functions rely on features of
`sympy` that are not exposed in the `sympy` installed with Ubuntu LTS
12.04.

In that particular instance, calls such as

```
x = symbols("x")
a = [x 1; 1 x]
det(a)
```

Can be replaced with

```
sympy.det(a)
```

Similarly for `trace`, `eigenvects`, ... . Note these are `sympy`
methods, not `Julia` methods that have been ported. (Hence,
`eigenvects` and not `eigvecs`.)
